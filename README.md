# Email Analysis Assistant by Satyam

## Overview

Welcome to the Email Analysis Assistant project! This tool leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to analyze email content, provide sentiment scores, categorize topics, and generate context-aware responses. Below are detailed instructions on how to run the project successfully.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/satyamcser/EmailAnalysisBotbySatyam.git

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   cd EmailAnalysisAssistant

3. Install the required dependencies.

pip install streamlit
pip install torch
pip install transformers

# Running the Email Analysis Assistant

1. Ensure you are in the project directory.

cd EmailAnalysisAssistant

2. Run the Streamlit app.

streamlit run main.py

3. Access the Email Analysis Assistant in your browser.

Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8501. You should see the Streamlit app interface.

4. Enter the email content in the provided text area.

5. Click the "Analyze" button to initiate the analysis.
6. 

## Notes and Considerations

- **Character Limit:** The current implementation has a maximum input character limit. Ensure your email content does not exceed this limit to obtain reliable results.

- **Model Size:** The language model used for response generation (`gpt2-small-dutch-embeddings`) has specific computational requirements. If performance is a concern, consider exploring smaller variants of the model.

- **Sentiment Analysis:** The sentiment score provided is a compound score from the NLTK SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.

- **Topic Categorization:** Basic topic categorization is implemented. You can enhance this by replacing it with more advanced methods.

- **Libraries Used:** The project utilizes NLTK for sentiment analysis and Hugging Face Transformers for response generation.

- **Web Interface:** The project uses Streamlit for the web interface.
